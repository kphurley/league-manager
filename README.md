# League Manager

League Manager's mission is to help non-techie types manage all sorts of leagues and easily display important information for all interested parties.

### Installation

Make sure node and npm are installed.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Once running, browse to localhost:1234 to take a look around.  Currently you can add leagues, seasons and teams but they don't do much yet.
